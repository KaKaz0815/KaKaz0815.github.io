            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h4>
                I was lucky and one of the first names I was thinking about using was available. ‘Fortunate Forecasts’ is the name I am going with, it has good alliteration and has a strong positive feel to it. If I wanted to purchase this domain name it would be $12 a year.  
            </h4>
            <h2>
                Site Purpose
            </h2>
            <h4>
                The purpose of Fortunate Forecasts is to let people know at a glance what the weather is going to be like throughout the day and week. Fortunate Forecast is to help those that have little time, but much to plan. This site brings a fun and trending edge to weather forecasts. Clean and simplistic icons help communicate clearly what viewer know what to expect right away. The aesthetic is inspired by the Japanese ‘Lucky Cat’ and their concept of ‘kawaii’ or cute. When looking at this weather page it is meant to instill a sense of good fortune and cuteness.
